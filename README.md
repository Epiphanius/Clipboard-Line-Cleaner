# Clipboard-Line-Cleaner
Automatically removes empty lines from clipboard text. A GPAI-prompted version as a GNOME Shell extension—so far—for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and 25.04. The scripts are copied to a folder named clipboard-line-cleaner@example.com and this folder is then placed in /home/user/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions. There is an installation script for the Clipboard Line Cleaner GNOME Extension in the folder clipboard-line-cleaner-extension, which does all the aforementioned. Sorry for any faults and unorthodoxies, don't use the scripts, they are faulty. A running version is to be found here: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/8385/clipboard-line-cleaner/.
